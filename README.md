# Cloud Embeddings: evaluate, finetune, deploy and store state-of-the-art pretrained embeddings

A repository for tackling cloud text pre-trained embeddings, from evaluation to deployment, including fine-tuning and vector stores, with an AWS cloud lens, with pretrained HuggingFace 🤗 embeddings and AWS.

A series of blog posts is coming soon to give more contexts to this part 👷🏻 

## Why do embeddings matter?

They're at the backbone of multiple ML systems we encounter every day; plus, as LLM encounter increasing popularity, the use-case of retrieval augmented generation (RAG) is a professional use of GenAI that heavily relies on embeddings.

## Objective of this repository.

Objective are simple:

* this collection showcases an end-to-end guide from selection, deployment to storage and retrieval embeddings with a cloud lens.
* thius collection will allow you to seamlessly embark your organization in a seamless journey, ensuring production readiness at every step.

## Repository structure
